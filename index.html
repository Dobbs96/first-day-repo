    <p>I am from New York. I am looking foward to learning about computer. I love technology. I enjoy watching Star Wars with my wife. My favorite character is Darth Maul. Star Wars: Clone Wars and Star Wars: Rebels is a must watch for all Star Wars fans.</p>

    <p>I am usually a quiet person, but once we have something in common we can talk for days. I am always looking to solve problem even I may not know anything. I also find it better to solve problems with otheres.</p>
